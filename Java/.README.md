**Java – Data Structures (Linked List, Stack, Queue)
**
This folder contains Java programs focused on core Data Structure implementations.  
All code was originally written using online compilers and organized here for clarity and interview preparation.


**1. Linked List**
- Individual Java files implementing single operations
  (e.g., insert, delete, search, reverse, find middle, remove duplicates)
- One combined file LinkedList.java which includes all major methods inside a single class**, making it useful for full implementation reference.

**2. Stack**
- Individual method-based files  
  (e.g., push, pop, peek, isEmpty)
- A complete implementation file Stack.java combining all functionalities into one class.

**3. Queue**
- Separate files demonstrating single operations  
  (e.g., enqueue, dequeue, front, rear)
- A full implementation file Queue.java that contains the entire queue logic in one place.


These programs were created for:
- Practicing Data Structures in Java  
- Improving algorithmic thinking  
- Preparing for coding interviews  
- Understanding how each operation works internally
