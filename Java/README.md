This folder contains Java programs focused on core Data Structure implementations.  
All code was originally written using online compilers and organized here for clarity and interview preparation.

**Structure of This Folder**

**1. Linked List**
- Individual Java files implementing **single operations**  
  (e.g., insert, delete, search, reverse, find middle, remove duplicates)
- One combined file **LinkedList.java** which includes **all major methods inside a single class**, making it useful for full implementation reference.

**2. Stack**
- Individual method-based files  
  (e.g., push, pop, peek, isEmpty)
- Multiple applications of stack are implemented

**3. Queue**
- Separate files demonstrating single operations  
  (e.g., enqueue, dequeue, front, rear)
- Multiple applications of Queues are implemented

- **4. Array Implementation**
- Multiple applications of array are implemented
