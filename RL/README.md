This directory contains a collection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations, each developed as an individual Jupyter notebook. Every notebook focuses on a specific RL algorithm or environment, demonstrating how agents learn and make decisions over time.

**1. Policy Gradient**
Implements a basic Policy Gradient method where the agent improves its policy directly using gradients of expected rewards.

**2. Q-Learning**
A classic value-based RL algorithm. The agent learns Q-values for state–action pairs and gradually improves its decision-making.

**3. SARSA**
An on-policy Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm. Unlike Q-Learning, SARSA updates values based on the action actually taken by the current policy.

**4. Traffic Light RL**
A simulation-based RL project where an agent learns to optimize traffic light timing to reduce congestion and waiting time.
